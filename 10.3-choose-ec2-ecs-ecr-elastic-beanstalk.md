# EC2, ECS, ECR and Elastic BeanStalk (summary)

- They are different services with different purposes, but in order to make it easier to understand I preferred to write just this md explaining each one summarized.

## EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud):

- EC2 is a remote server that you can access and configure everything by yourself.
- You are able to select the operating system, configure networking, upload your project to this server, etc...
- You need to configure everything manually. However, running a simple API on EC2 is straightforward.
- One "problem" is that you need to do maintenance on this server in order to avoid deprecation and security issues on your services dependencies.

## ECS (Elastic Container Service):

- Fully managed container orchestration service that allows you to run Docker containers in the cloud.
- Simplifies the deployment, management, and scaling of containerized applications using familiar AWS services.
- ECS supports both Fargate (serverless) and EC2 launch types.

## ECR (Elastic Container Registry):

- ECR is a fully managed Docker container registry that makes it easy to store, manage, and deploy Docker container images.
- It integrates seamlessly with ECS, allowing you to store your container images securely and deploy them to ECS clusters.
- ECR supports private container image repositories, fine-grained access control, and integration with AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM).

## Elastic Beanstalk:

- Elastic Beanstalk is a platform as a service (PaaS) that automates the deployment and management of web applications and services.
- It automatically handles the deployment, capacity provisioning, load balancing, auto-scaling, and application health monitoring.
- Elastic Beanstalk supports multiple programming languages and frameworks, including Java, .NET, Node.js, Python, Ruby, Go, and Docker.

## When to use each one

- Use EC2 when you need full control over your virtual servers.
- ECR + ECS
  - Use ECR to securely store and manage your Docker container images.
  - Use ECS when you want to run Docker containers at scale with managed orchestration.
- Use Elastic Beanstalk as a fully managed platform for deploying web applications and services.

### In other words

- I suggest using EC2 just for small projects and if you/your team have the basic knowledge to configure it.
- ECR + ECS is a good option for a startup that already has its services packaged inside containers. With this you can easily run a small project and also a large one.
- Consider using Elastic Beanstalk if your product/service is growing and you prefer to minimize time spent managing your server
