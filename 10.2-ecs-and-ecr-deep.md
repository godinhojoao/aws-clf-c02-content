# Amazon ECS and ECR services

## Elastic Container Service (ECS)

- ECS is a Container orchestration service that addresses the challenges of provisioning, scaling, configuring, and deploying containers, which can be overwhelming, especially for larger applications. By automating these tasks, container orchestration simplifies management and ensures efficient operation.
  - It's easier than AWS EKs because it abstracts much of the complexity of managing containers on the AWS console.
  - It's important to mention that ECS is closely tied to AWS. If you prefer more freedom, you should consider EKS, which is based on Kubernetes, an open-source project. With EKS, you have more control over your container orchestration.
- With ECS, unlike EC2, manual maintenance tasks are not required. AWS is managing your server and doing maintencaes regularly in order to avoid security vulnerabilities, and etc...

### What is an ECS Cluster and how to configure one?

- A cluster is a group of container instances that you manage as a single entity. It can also be called as a `container orchestration platform`.
- These instances can be EC2 instances or Fargate instances.
- A cluster provides the foundational infrastructure where you can run your containerized applications.
  - The cluster provides you the "automatic AWS maintenance", that without ECS it would be necessary as mentioned before.
  - ECS clusters provide networking capabilities to enable communication between containers within the same cluster and with other AWS services. You can configure networking settings such as VPC, subnets, security groups, and load balancers to ensure secure and efficient communication between containers.

### Where is the Elastic Container Registry (ECR) linked to our ECS?

- Basically when we are configuring our task definition we need to set the [container definition](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/APIReference/API_ContainerDefinition.html). You just set where is this container stored and which is the port that it is being exposed.

### What is a task on ECS?

- First you need to know that to create a task on ECS we need to create a [Task definition](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/task_definitions.html). Inside a task definition you will configure important things, for example:
  - The container definitions that will compose the application.
  - The necessary resources, for example, cpu and memory.
  - [Network mode](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/bestpracticesguide/networking-networkmode.html)
  - If it will be using EC2 or Fargate.
  - Configure also the `IAM Task Role` that is used to interact with other AWS services.

### What is a service and how to configure one on ECS?

- We use a service definition to create an ECS service. Where we need to define the configurations, for example:
  - Choose which task definition to use and how many instances of that task definition to run concurrently
  - Deployment Configuration: Specify deployment options such as minimum healthy percent and maximum percent.
  - (Optional) If your application requires external traffic to be distributed, you can configure a load balancer within the service definition.

### ECS Task Scheduler

- The [ECS Task Scheduler](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/scheduling_tasks.html) handles scheduling tasks on containers. Developers can set up the ECS Task Scheduler to run a task at a specific time or after a given interval, for example, run a cronjob.
  - It can be used to run cronjobs, to ensure that the newest version of containers are working normally, and more.

### ECS using [AWS Fargate](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/AWS_Fargate.html)

- The only difference is where/how the containers are hosted on AWS.
- When running containers on virtual machines (such as EC2), we still need to manage and configure these VMs. To avoid this additional work, we can use AWS Fargate to run serverless containers, allowing us to focus on what matters: the business.

## Elastic Container Registry (ECR) -> Features and advantages

- Security: ECR ensures container data security by encrypting it at rest with Amazon S3's server-side encryption. Integration with AWS IAM simplifies access control through policy configuration. And there is also [Image scanning](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECR/latest/userguide/image-scanning.html) that helps to identify software vulnerabilities in your container images.
- Ease of Integration: Seamless integration with AWS services like ECS and EKS simplifies container deployment.
- Fully Managed: AWS handles all aspects of the container registry service, including infrastructure provisioning, scaling, security updates, and maintenance tasks. This means you can focus on developing and deploying your containerized applications without the operational overhead of managing the underlying infrastructure.
- Cost-Effectiveness: Pay-as-you-go pricing model optimizes costs without upfront commitments.
- [Cross-Region replication](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECR/latest/userguide/replication.html): Turns easy distribute your container images across multiple regions, reducing latency and improving the availability of your applications worldwide.
- [Lifecycle polices](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECR/latest/userguide/LifecyclePolicies.html): One or more rules to determine which images in a repository should be expired.
  - Important: If you are using AWS ECR Replication to make copies across different regions this lifecycle polices should be configured for each region of your repository.
