# CLF-C02 Exam Questions tips

## Questions general informations

- Multiple choice (one correct)
- Multiple response (more than one correct, the number of correct is mentioned)
- Both of them the exam don't show if you selected the right one.
- You can flag questions that you are not sure and want to review after.

## Distractors options - USE ELIMINATION

- Read the question and answers patiently and silently without moving your mouth.
- REMOVE ALL ANSWERS YOU KNOW ARE WRONG.
- If the answer seems obvious, be carefulâ€”it might be wrong.

  ### Answering process - ELIMINATION

  - There are a lot of services, we can't remember all of them at the exam day.
  - So, during the exam you will experience two moods:
    - **I know the answer**: review, think, see options, mark the right one.
    - **I don't know the answer**: First of all, **remove** the options you know are **distractors**. Then answer.

## Trick questions, example: (got from skill builder free exam pre set clf-c02):

- "You are migrating an on-premise linux server with an Oracle database, that runs on it. Which service should you use?"
  [] - A -> AWS Database Migration Service (DMS)
  [X] - B -> AWS Application Migration Service (AWS MGN)
  - The trick is because the question is also mentioning a database.
  - But actually you are migrating an **on-premise linux server**.
  - And for that you use AWS Application Migration Service (AWS MGN).
